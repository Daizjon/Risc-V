# RISC-V Command Line Calculator

## Overview

This project implements a command-line integer calculator in RISC-V assembly.

The objective was to design and execute arithmetic operations directly at the instruction level, reinforcing understanding of register manipulation, control flow, system calls, and low-level program structure.



## Features

- Integer arithmetic operations
- Command-line style input handling
- Register-based computation
- Explicit control flow implementation
- Manual instruction-level logic



## Implementation Details

The calculator was written entirely in RISC-V assembly and executed in a RISC-V simulation environment.

Core concepts demonstrated:

- Register allocation and management
- Branch and jump instructions
- Arithmetic instruction usage
- Stack and memory interaction (if applicable)
- System call usage for I/O

All logic is implemented without high-level language abstractions.



## File Structure

- `riscv_calculator.s`  
  Main RISC-V assembly implementation of calculator logic.



## Concepts Demonstrated

- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) fundamentals
- Low-level arithmetic implementation
- Control flow in assembly
- Hardware-near computation modeling



This project demonstrates foundational understanding of RISC-V architecture and low-level software execution.
